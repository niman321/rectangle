method overriding
method overriding happens when same method with different implementation exists in parent class and child class.
why should we override a method:
1) flexibility
when we inherits from a class and if we do not like some methods we can modify them.
Rules
1) private methods and constructors can not be overridden because they dont participate in inheritance.
2) if we want to override something we must recreate that exact method inside the child class and can have different
implementations only access modifiers can be different. it can have more visibility then the method inside the parent class.
note:
right click in editor inside your class and click on generate-->select the fields that you want in your constructor and click on done.

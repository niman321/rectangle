Abstraction:
allows us to simplify code by hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to the user.
in java we can achieve this in two ways
1) abstraction classes
2) interface:
interface is very similar to a class we can have private methods default methods abstract methods static and methods.
we cant have instance fields in an interface because we dont have instance fields we also cant have a constructor in an interface.

when we should we learn about interface:
when objects are closely related to each other and if there is (Is a) relationship between classes then
 we should go with abstract classes if we want to use abstraction.
 if objects are not related to each other then we should implement abstraction with the help of interfaces.

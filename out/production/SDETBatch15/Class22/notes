Overriding
   its a mechanism in java that allows us to have same method name with different parameters.
   parameters can be different in number, type, and sequence
why should we overload method,
   1)method overloading allows us to reuse same method name again and again that we do not have to have to come with different
   method names if we are doing the same thing again again.
   2) it allows us to write clean code.

how to overload a method.
   we can overload a method by redefining it with different parameters.

Method Overriding
---------------
   its a mechanism in java that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method.
Why we should oeverride a method
    if a child class does not like the implementation of the parent class it has the flexibility that iut can override method,
Syntax of override
    there must be a parent child relationship between two classes.

Rules of Overriding
   1) to override a method there must be parent child relationship between to classes.
   2) if something can not be inherited we cant override it, for example methods and constructors.
   3)visibility of a method can be increased for example if something has default access or protected access we can make it public
   but we cant make it private.

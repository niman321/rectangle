Exception:
is an unwanted behavior which occours at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly.
Exception Handling:
is a machanism that allows us runtime errors and help us to avoid runtime error messages to something similar that a normaal user can understand.
Hiw we implement exception handling in java.
we have new keywords and new blocks of code which allow us to handle exception in java
Blocks of code 1) try 2) catch 3) finally    4) throw   5) throws

try Block:
in the try block we write the code which may throw an exception
Catch Block:
contains the back up code, we put the code that we want to execute in case of failure.



how it works:
we can have mutiple catch blocks with one try block . each handling a different error.

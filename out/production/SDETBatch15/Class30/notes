Sets:
Sets do not allow Dublicate values.
there are three types:

1=HashSet
2=LinkedHashSet
3=TreeSet
Hashset-------most widely used
Upside: it has  the fastest speed
downSide: it does not maintain the insertion order

LinkedHashSet------
upside: maintains the insertion order
downside: Slower than HashSet

TreeSets-------
upside: keep the data sorted
downside: its slower than all

Map-------
  Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have the main types of Maps as well
  1= HashMap--- most widely used it does not maintain the insertion order
  2= LinkedHashMap----maintain the insertion order but slow
  3= TreeMap

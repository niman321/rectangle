Polymorphism


Abstraction:
is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
why we should use Abstraction:
1) it reduces the code complexity
2) it allows the end user to focus on using the features instead of worrying about the implementation.
Syntax:
we need to declare the methods as abstract if we are not planning to provide the implementation.
we also need to write abstract keyword with the class as well.
